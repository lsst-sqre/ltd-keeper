An Edition is a publication of a :doc:`Product <products>`\ â€™s documentation.
Editions allow products to have multiple versions of documentation published at once, from separate URLs.
For example, the 'latest' documentation might be published to ``docs.project.org``, but documentation for the tagged 'v1' release might be published to ``docs.project.org/v/v1``.

Editions are merely pointers to a :doc:`Build <builds>`; an Edition is updated by pointing to a newer :doc:`Build <builds>` (see :http:patch:`/editions/(int:id)`).

Tracking modes
==============

Editions track :doc:`Builds <builds>`.
This means that when a new :doc:`Build <builds>` is uploaded, any edition for that :doc:`Product <products>` that tracks that *kind* of build will be updated.
An Edition's tracking mode is given with the ``mode`` field of :http:get:`/editions/(int:id)`, and can either be set initially (:http:post:`/products/(slug)/editions/`) or updated on an existing Edition (:http:patch:`/editions/(int:id)`).
There are two tracking modes, currently:

======== =============
``mode`` Description
======== =============
1        Git ref
2        LSST document
======== =============

Git reference mode (default)
----------------------------

This mode tracks Builds with a specific Git ref (branch name or tag).

To use this mode, the ``mode`` field of the Edition must have a value of ``1``.
Then ``tracked_refs`` field is an array of Git ref strings that determine the value of ``git_refs`` a :doc:`Build <builds>` needs to be published as the Edition.

As an example, an Edition has these fields:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "mode": 1,
     "tracked_refs": ["master"]
   }

Then a :doc:`Build <builds>` with ``{"git_refs": ["master"]}`` will be published by the Edition.

LSST document mode
------------------

This mode makes the Edition track the :doc:`Build <builds>` with the most recent LSST document semantic version tag.
LSST document semantic version tags are formatted as ``v<Major>.<Minor>``.

The Edition's mode field must have a value of ``2`` to use this mode.

Note that until the first :doc:`Build <builds>` with a semantic version tag is published, an Edition with this mode will track the ``master`` Git ref.
