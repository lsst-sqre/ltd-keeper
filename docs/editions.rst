An Edition is a publication of a :doc:`Product <products>`\ â€™s documentation.
Editions allow products to have multiple versions of documentation published at once, from separate URLs.
For example, the 'latest' documentation might be published to ``docs.project.org``, but documentation for the tagged 'v1' release might be published to ``docs.project.org/v/v1``.

Editions are merely pointers to a :doc:`Build <builds>`; an Edition is updated by pointing to a newer :doc:`Build <builds>` (see :http:patch:`/editions/(int:id)`).
