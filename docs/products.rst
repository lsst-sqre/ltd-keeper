Products - `/products`
######################

The ``/products/`` API allows you to list products, create new products, and update products (including adding new builds and editions).

In LTD Keeper, a Product is the root entity associated with a documentation project.
Generally, a single Sphinx documentation repository maps to a Product.
LTD Keeper can host documentation for several products.

The actual documentation associated with a Product is manifested by **builds**.
In turn, builds are the source of **editions**, which are published versions of the Product's documentation.
