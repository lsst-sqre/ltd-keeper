1.15.1 (2019-08-06)
===================

- Fixed a bug that prevented logging configuration and authorization tests with the "v2" endpoint for ``POST products/<product>/builds/``.
  [`DM-20768 <https://jira.lsst.org/browse/DM-20768>`_]

- Added additional tests to ensure that editions tracking ``master`` branches were automatically being created for documents using the ``lsst_doc`` tracking mode for the main edition.
  No application fixes were required.
  [`DM-20487 <https://jira.lsst.org/browse/DM-20487>`_]

1.15.0 (2019-07-08)
===================

- This version introduces a new "v2" endpoint for ``POST products/<product>/builds/`` that returns two new fields: ``post_prefix_urls`` and ``post_dir_urls``.
  These fields provide a mapping of presigned POST URLs and associated fields for different prefixes/directories in the S3 bucket associated with the registered build.
  The benefit of using presigned POST URLs is that clients no longer need their own AWS S3 credentials.
  LTD Keeper exclusively maintains control over S3 credentials and restricts access to S3 resources through these presigned URLs.

  The `LTD Conveyor <https://ltd-conveyor.lsst.io>`_ client, version 0.5.0, now uses this new version of the endpoint.
  
  Version 2 endpoints are accessible through a ``application/vnd.ltdkeeper.v2+json`` Accept header.
  Existing clients are unaffected by this change as the default endpoint will continue to operate for the foreseeable future.

  [`DM-20140 <https://jira.lsst.org/browse/DM-20140>`_]

- Fix a bug during product creation (``POST /products``) where the product object needs to be flushed in the SQLAlchemy session before creating the default edition.

- Minor PEP 8 fixes for regex strings and string comparisons.

1.14.3 (2018-10-09)
===================

- Fixes a problem with the new ``keeper.s3.delete_directory`` implementation when the S3 prefix has no corresponding objects.

`DM-16061 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15518>`_

1.14.2 (2018-10-08)
===================

- Fixes a bug in ``keeper.s3.delete_directory`` related to "directories" that have 1000 or more objects.
  The S3 and Boto APIs for deleting objects cannot handle more than 1000 object keys at once.
  Now this function internally paginates over objects to bypass this limitation.

- Adds an experimental Kubernetes deployment of Flower_ to help monitor the Celery task queue.

`DM-15518 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15518>`__.

1.14.1 (2018-08-12)
===================

- Removed unneeded code from the ``new_build`` route that was throwing an error if the build corresponded to an edition with a manual tracking mode (as opposed to Git refs).

`DM-15416 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15416>`__.

1.14.0 (2018-08-09)
===================

- New ``autoincrement`` feature for Edition slugs.
  Now an edition can be created with ``autoincrement=True``.
  Instead of passing a known slug, this features computes the next available integer slug.
  This feature is designed for the notebook-based report system to create report instances with monotonically increasing instance numbers.

- New ``manual`` tracking mode.
  This mode ensures that an edition is *not* updated automatically with a new build.
  The edition can only be updated with a manual PATCH request that modifies the build URL.

`DM-15243 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15243>`__.

1.13.0 (2018-07-11)
===================

- Make an Edition's ``tracked_refs`` field ``None`` when its tracking mode is not ``git_refs`` (only the ``git_refs`` mode uses ``tracked_refs``).
- Do not require a ``tracked_refs`` when creating an Edition that does not use the ``git_refs`` tracking mode.

`DM-15075 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15075>`__.

1.12.0 (2018-07-10)
===================

- Update to Python 3.6.6 (in Docker base image and Travis).
- Update boto to 1.7.54 (for Python 3.6.6 compatibility).
- Update Celery to 4.2.0 (to fix a compatibility issue with Kombu 4.2's release).

1.11.0 (2018-07-09)
===================

This release improves and expands the system of edition tracking modes.

There are three new tracking modes:

- ``eups_major_release`` tracks an EUPS major release tag (``vX_Y``) and its Git variant (``X.Y``).
- ``eups_weekly_release`` tracks an EUPS weekly release tag (``w_YYYY_WW``) and its Git variant (``w.YYYY.WW``).
- ``eups_daily_release`` tracks an EUPS daily release tag (``d_YYYY_MM_DD``) and its Git variant (``d.YYYY.MM.DD``).

In addition, the code for determining whether an edition should rebuild or not given the tracking mode has been refactored out of the ``Edition.should_rebuild`` model method and into a new ``keeper.editiontracking`` subpackage.
Each tracking mode is now built around a uniform interface.

`DM-15016 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-15016>`__.

1.10.0 (2018-06-12)
===================

Both ``.`` and ``_`` characters can now appear in edition slugs.
Previously these characters were automatically converted to ``-`` characters in edition names, but this prevented editions from being named after semantic version tags or EUPS tags.

`DM-14772 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-14772>`__.

1.9.0 (2018-05-03)
==================

This release includes the celery task queuing system and major internal updates to the application structure and dependencies.

`DM-14122 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-14122>`__.

API updates
-----------

- Endpoints that launch asynchronous queue tasks now provide a ``queue_url`` field.
  This is a URL to an endpoint that provides status information on the queued task.
  For example, after ``PATCH``\ ing an edition with a new build, you can watch the ``queue_url`` to see when the rebuild is complete.
  The ``queue_url``\ s are provided by the new ``GET /queue/(id)`` endpoint.

- We don't yet provide a way to query the queue in general --- you can only get URLs by being the user that triggered the task.

- Endpoints, especially ``PATCH /editions/(id)``, should no longer timeout (500 error) for large documentation projects.

- The ``/editions/(id)`` resource includes a new ``pending_rebuild`` field.
  This field acts as a semaphore and is set to ``true`` if there is a pending rebuild task.
  You can't ``PATCH`` the edition's ``build_url`` when ``pending_rebuild`` is ``true``.
  If necessary, an operator can ``PATCH`` ``pending_rebuild`` to ``false`` if the Celery task that rebuilds the edition failed.

Deployment updates
------------------

- New deployment: ``keeper-redis``.
  This deployment consists of a single Redis container (official ``redis:4-alpine`` image).
  There is no persistent storage or high-availability at this time (this was judged a fair trade off since the Celery queue is inherently transient).
- New service: ``keeper-redis``.
  This service fronts the ``keeper-redis`` deployment.
- New deployment: ``keeper-worker-deployment``.
  This deployment mirrors ``keeper-deployment``, except that the run ``command`` starts a Celery worker for the LTD Keeper application.
  This deployment can be scaled up to provide additional workers.
  The ``keeper-worker-deployment`` is *not* fronted by a service since the Celery workers pull tasks from ``keeper-redis``.

Internal updates
----------------

- Dependency updates:

  - Flask 0.12.2
  - Requests 2.18.4
  - uwsgi 2.0.17
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy 2.3.2
  - PyMySQL 0.8.0
  - Flask-Migrate 2.1.1

- Switched from Flask-Script to ``flask.cli``.
  The Makefile now fronts most of the Flask commands for convience during development.
  Run ``make help`` to learn more.

- Application architecture improvements:

  - Moved the Flask application factory out of ``__init__.py`` to ``keeper.appfactory``.
  - Moved the ``get_auth_token`` route to the ``api`` blueprint.
  - Moved DB connection object to ``keeper.models.db``.

- Add ``Product.from_url()`` and ``Edition.from_url()`` methods for consistency with ``Build.from_url``.

- Logging updates:

  - Now we specifically set up the ``keeper`` logger instead of the root logger.
    This keeps things manageable when turning on debug-level logging.

  - New app configuration for logging level.
    Debug-level logging is used in the development and testing profiles, while info-level logging is used in production.

- New celery app factory in ``keeper.celery``.

- New Celery task queuing infrastructure in ``keeper.taskrunner``.
  In a request context, application code can add an asynchronous task by calling ``append_task_to_chain()`` with a Celery task signature.
  These task signatures are persisted, within the request context, in ``flask.g.tasks``.
  Just before a route handler returns it should call ``launch_task_chain()``, which launches the task chain asynchronously.
  The advantage of this whole-context chain is that it orders asynchronous tasks: editions are rebuilt before the dashboard is created.
  If a task is known to be fully independent of other tasks it could just be launched immediately.

- New Celery tasks:

  - ``keeper.tasks.editionrebuild.rebuild_edition()``: copies a build on S3 onto the edition.
  - ``keeper.tasks.dashboardbuild.build_dashboard()``: triggers LTD Dasher.

- Replace ``Edition.rebuild()`` with ``Edition.set_pending_rebuild`` to use the new ``rebuild_edition`` task.

1.8.0 (2017-12-13)
==================

Adds logging with `structlog <http://www.structlog.org/en/stable/>`__.
Structlog is configured to generate key-value log strings in test/development and JSON-formatted strings in production.
The ``@log_route`` decorator creates a new logger and binds metadata about a request, such as a unique request ID, method and path.
It also logs the response latency and status when the route returns.
The auth decorators bind the username once the user is known.

`DM-12974 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12974>`__.

1.7.0 (2017-12-13)
==================

In this version we've dropped the ``nginx-ssl-proxy`` pod that we've used thus far and adopted the standard Kubernetes Ingress resources for TLS termination instead.
This means that the Keeper service is now a NodePort-type service.
The advantage of using Ingress is that we can rely on Google to maintain that resource and ensure that the TLS-terminating proxy is updated with new security patches.

`DM-12923 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12923>`__.

1.6.0 (2017-12-13)
==================

- Migrate to setuptools-based packaging.
  LTD Keeper is now ``pip install``\ 'd into the Docker image at build time using the local sdist distribution (there are no plans to put LTD Keeper itself on PyPI).

- Use `setuptools_scm <https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/>`__ to automatically establish the application version based on the Git tag.

- Automate the creation of the Docker image in Travis CI.
  The image is tagged with the branch or tag name.
  The build for the ``master`` branch is labeled as ``latest``.

- Build and testing are coordinated with a brand new Makefile.

`DM-12914 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12914>`__.

1.5.0 (2017-12-13)
==================

Added the explicit idea of tracking modes to edition resources.
This determines whether or not an edition is updated with a new build.
The mode is set with the ``mode`` field of the ``/products/<product>/edition`` resource.

The default tracking mode (``git_refs``) is to update if a build resource has the right git ref (a tag or branch name).

The new ``lsst_doc`` tracking mode allows an edition to watch for builds with git refs formatted as ``v<Major>.<Minor>`` and always publish the newest such tag.
This supports the revised LSST DM document release procedure: https://developer.lsst.io/v/DM-11952/docs/change-controlled-docs.html

`DM-12356 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-12356>`__.
